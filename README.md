# alx-files_manager

This project is a summary of my back-end learning journey. It encompasses various concepts and technologies including authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination, and background processing.

The objective of this project is to build a simple platform for file management. The key features of this platform include:

1. User Authentication via Token: Users will be able to authenticate themselves using a token-based authentication system.
2. Listing of files: Users can view a list of all files uploaded to the platform.
3. File Upload: Users can upload new files to the platform.
4. File Permission Management: Users can change the permission settings of their uploaded files.
5. File Viewing: Users can view the contents of a file.
6. Thumbnail Generation: The platform will automatically generate thumbnails for image files.

 It is  a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.
